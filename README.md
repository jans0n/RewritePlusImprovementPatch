Note: This uses SP's staging branch as a base for the patch. This means that there is a possibility of global flags getting corrupted when updates are pushed to the staging branch. Please disable automatic updates for Rewrite+ on steam to prevent breaking the game any further. Please note that this also means you won't see any fixes to text/images/etc from Sekai Project until I update this patch. 

## Current changes

- Sizuru -> Shizuru

- Uncensored images are restored from the Japanese version of Rewrite+

- "Shake it now, baby now" scene restored

- Opening and ending videos now have subtitles

- An issue with the ending video's audio bitrate has been fixed

## Reporting bugs
