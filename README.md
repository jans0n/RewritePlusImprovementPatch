Note: This uses SP's staging branch as a base for the patch. This means that there is a possibility of global flags getting corrupted when updates are pushed to the staging branch. Please disable automatic updates for Rewrite+ on steam to prevent breaking the game any further. Please note that this also means you won't see any fixes to text/images/etc. 

### Current changes:

Sizuru -> Shizuru

Uncensored images are restored from the Japanese version of Rewrite+

"Shake it now, baby now" scene restored
